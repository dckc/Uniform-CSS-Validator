Uniform CSS Validator
=====================

CSS syntax evolves in a backward- and forward-compatible way; the CSS
2.1 spec includes a unform grammar, applicable to all CSS versions.
The original (2002) W3C CSS validator predates this unform grammar and
maintenance is becoming an undue burden as a result. This is
an attempt to build a validator using the uniform syntax.

So far, it's just an exercise in learning scala development.  It
consists of one failing test.


Emacs and Scala
---------------

scala-mode in 2.7.6-final sorta works, though it doesn't
seem to recover after parsing /*...*/ style comments.

Haven't gotten sbt working with emacs yet.
