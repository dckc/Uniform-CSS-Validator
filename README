=====================
Uniform CSS Validator
=====================

CSS syntax evolves in a backward- and forward-compatible way; the CSS
2.1 specification__ includes a unform grammar, applicable to all CSS
versions.  The `original (2002) W3C CSS Validator`__ predates this
unform grammar and maintenance is becoming an undue burden as a
result. This is an attempt to build a validator using the uniform
syntax.

This is also something of an exercise in learning Scala development.
Provided you have some popular tools installed (see `Scala
development`_ below for details), you should be able to confirm that
all tests pass::

 cssval$ sbt test
 ...
 [info] Run: 6, Passed: 6, Errors: 0, Failed: 0

Scala development
-----------------

    Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to
    express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and
    type-safe way.

    -- `Introducing Scala`__

__ http://www.scala-lang.org/node/25

The compiler and such are open source and easy to find
from the `Scala Programming Language`__ site.

__ http://www.scala-lang.org/

For audit trail purposes, the md5 checksum of the package I
dowloaded is::

  82934acf64d0c026de78b84e984f6743  scala-2.7.6.final.tgz

Once you download and unpack that, you should be able to see that
interpreter and compiler work as per `Getting Started with Scala`__.

Simple Build Tool (sbt)
***********************

The Scala tribe seems to use sbt__ in place of make or ant.

__ http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

Audit trail::

  MD5 (sbt-launcher-0.5.5.jar) = e3593448b3be17ce1666c6241b8d2f90

The directory layout of this project follows `sbt/maven conventions`__::

  src/
    main/
      resources/
         <files to include in main jar here>
      scala/
         <main Scala sources>
      java/
         <main Java sources>
    test/
      resources
         <files to include in test jar here>
      scala/
         <test Scala sources>
      java/
         <test Java sources>

I haven't mastered `library management`__; I just copied .jar files
into some ``lib`` directories until things started working.

ScalaTest
*********

ScalaTest__ is a leading test framework for Scala.

__ http://www.scalatest.org/download

Audit trail::

  MD5 (scalatest-1.0.zip) = d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e

I unpacked it and put scala-test-1.0.jar in ``lib``... or was it
``project/boot/scala-2.7.6/lib``.


Emacs and Scala
***************

With ``scala-mode``, emacs helps with indentation and syntax coloring.
With ``sbt.el``, emacs can navigate compiler errors (with some
glitches). My set-up is pretty rough; some notes::

 ;;;
 ; http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads
 (add-to-list 'load-path "/home/connolly/src/scala-2.7.6.final/misc/scala-tool-support/emacs")
 (add-to-list 'exec-path "/home/connolly/src/scala-2.7.6.final/bin")
 (add-to-list 'exec-path "/home/connolly/bin")
 (require 'scala-mode-auto)
